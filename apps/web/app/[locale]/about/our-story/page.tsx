                "Nearly three years ago, I established GanzAfrica with a clear mission: to build local human capital to champion the use of data and evidence to support public services and development agencies in decision-making, as they deliver essential programs to enhance people's standard of living, health, climate and environment, all critical food systems sectors. This initiative stemmed from many years of learning and experience gained working closely with public institutions and policy implementing partners. Over time, I noticed significant gaps in local capacity, efficiency and innovation potential, which resulted in slow progress and below-par developmental outcomesâ€”especially within food systems sectors. Although GanzAfrica was officially founded in 2022, its roots go back much further. The ideas germinated from years of observing how well-meaning policies often fell short in implementation, primarily due to a lack of capacity. This has hampered progress across many African countries, where even good solutions have also been ineffective due to their application without contextual consideration."}

It identifies promising young professionals with the right attitudes and equips them with the skills to support mandated institutions, make evidence-based decisions, adopt systems thinking, and drive sustainable change. Fellows are strategically placed as change agents in partner public institutions, where they gain invaluable real-world experience while contributing fresh ideas. The interplay between personal skills, theoretical training and practical application is at the heart of what makes GanzAfrica unique and impactful."}
